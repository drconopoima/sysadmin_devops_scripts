## From comparison among two files show side-by-side differences only. “grep” it’s filtering out lines that don’t have contents after the parenthesis “(”. Taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38950802/how-to-display-line-numbers-in-side-by-side-diff-in-unix.

# sdiff -l file1 file2 | cat -n | grep -v -e '($'

## From comparison among two files show side-by-side similarities only. “grep” it’s filtering out lines that don’t have contents after the parenthesis “|” symbol. Idem

# diff -y file1 file2 | cat -n | grep -v -e '($'

## Run Bourne Shell-compatible "bash" scripts in sh (within limitations e.g. not `shopt`)
## Mainly to avoid busybox embedded systems to install as dependency complete bash shell
# echo -e "#!/usr/bin/env sh\nsh \$@\n" > /usr/bin/bash && chmod a+x /usr/bin/bash

## Generate sequentially numbered files:
# LOWER_RANGE=0
# UPPER_RANGE=99
# DIRECTORY='/tmp'
# EXTENSION='.txt'
# for number in $(seq $LOWER_RANGE $UPPER_RANGE); do touch ${DIRECTORY}/${number}.${EXTENSION}; done
